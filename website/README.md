This is the website of [Dotsync](https://github.com/mbaraa/dotsync), IDK, it seems cute to have a landing page and docs outside the repo's readme!

### Run it locally:

I have no idea why you'd wanna do this, but here'e how:

#### You'll need:

1. Docker and Docker Compose
1. An internet connection
1. Sveltekit builds fast so you won't need as much time as the server...

#### You'll do:

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `docker compose up -d`

- (Optional) use [Rex](https://github.com/mbaraa/rex) for a minimalistic deployment automation.
